# How I Made This Presentation
## Using the tools of the web to present about it

As web professionals we spend years developing expertise with the tools of our trade, but when it’s time to give a presentation we throw our lot in with Powerpoint, or Keynote, or maybe Google or Prezi. Well times have changed, and now there are good *web* tools we can present with. In this talk I’ll show you how to make the task of preparing a presentation more like what you already do best, how to leverage your existing tool sets, and how choosing this approach can improve both collaboration and sharing.
