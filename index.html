						<h1>My Presentation History</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							I went to my first HighEdWeb conference back in 2007 and I was powerfully impressed by the conference, the community, and the presentations. Presentations weren't really a big part of my life, but I knew I wanted to be a part of this thing and I made up my mind to submit a proposal the next year if I'd be able to attend the conference.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>HighEdWeb 2008</h2>
						<h3>Higher Ed on Rails</h3>
						<p>Powerpoint</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							As it turned out I was able to go, and my proposal was accepted. I prepared my talk, Higher Ed on Rails, in Powerpoint in accordance with the ancient form. There were a lot of screenshots and a lot of bullets and maybe a few transitions, and everything worked ok.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Then</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>HighEdWeb 2009 <small>(missed it)</small></li>
							<li>HighEdWeb 2010 <small>(didn't present)</small></li>
						</ul>
						<p>But meanwhile ...</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							That was 2008. I wasn't able to attend in 2009 so I missed all the excitement (dropshadow slide). In 2010 I was there but didn't present.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>Back Home</h2>
						<dl>
							<dt>DEDCC</dt>
							<dd>Digital Environment Development and Coordinating Committee (DEDCC)</dd>
						</dl>
						<p>Keynote</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							I presented back home, though. I was asked to speak about HTML5 to a group called DEDCC and I wanted things to look good. I'd been presenting more back at home, mostly in PowerPoint, which I never liked much, and several times more recently in Google Presentations, which as you know (or should) offer a lot of advantages for collaboration. But as nice as this tool is in various ways, it didn't look great. It let you use the web, but in a lowest-common-denominator sort of way. Now I'm no designer but I wanted my presentations to look better without going through excruciating discomfort to get there. So I tried Apple's Keynote. This was definitely a better tool. It suffers from weird little limitations of its own, but it tended to snap things to where I wanted them, put options where I expected them, and generally feel less frustrating. I had fun with the talk, and it looked better than anything else I'd done.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>HighEdWeb 2011</h2>
						<h3>Swinging with Sinatra</h3>
						<p>Powerpoint</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							HighEdWeb 2011 was busy conference for me. I did too much. I volunteered for a few things (registration, band), I presented a poster, and I gave another 45-minute talk. This time I wanted to do something more dynamic and exciting, a live programming demonstration. As luck would have it it was a little more exciting than I would have liked, as my computer (yes, this very computer) let me down (core dump slide) mid stream. This proved a poplar diversion, and I got to repeat it two more times. One thing I promised myself was that next time I'd deliver a talk I could present in jeans.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>HighEdWeb 2012</h2>
						<h3>You Can Convert!</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							In 2012 Jason and I collaborated on a talk, and because we wanted it to look nice we used Keynote. Now this time the tool really got in the way. Jason knows a lot more about typography than I do, but I know Keynote better. Our collaboration consisted of sharing some notes, and then working on a single Keynote file in a shared Dropbox folder, being careful not to overwrite each others changes. We know each other well and we got through this ok but it was really the last straw.

						Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
