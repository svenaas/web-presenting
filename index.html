						<h1>My Presentation History</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							I went to my first HighEdWeb conference back in 2007 and I was powerfully impressed by the conference, the community, and the presentations. Presentations weren't really a big part of my life, but I knew I wanted to be a part of this thing and I made up my mind to submit a proposal the next year if I'd be able to attend the conference.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="none">
						<h2>HighEdWeb 2008</h2>
						<h3>Higher Ed on Rails</h3>
						<p>Powerpoint</p>
						<img src="img/higheredonrails.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							As it turned out I was able to go, and my proposal was accepted. I prepared my talk, Higher Ed on Rails, in Powerpoint in accordance with the ancient form. There were a lot of screenshots and a lot of bullets and maybe a few transitions, and everything worked ok.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="none">
						<h2>Then</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">HighEdWeb 2009 <small class="hella fragment roll-in">(missed it)</small></li>
							<li class="fragment">HighEdWeb 2010 <small class="fragment">(didn't present)</small></li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">But meanwhile ...</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							That was 2008. I wasn't able to attend in 2009 so I missed all the excitement (dropshadow slide). In 2010 I was there but didn't present.
						</aside>

					<section data-transition="none">
						<h2>Back Home</h2>
						<h3>HighEdWeb 2012 Report</h3>
						<p>Google Presentation</p>
						<img src="img/heweb10.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							I'd been presenting more back at home, though, mostly in PowerPoint, which I never liked much, and several times more recently in Google Presentations, including this example reporting some of the lessons learned at HighEdWeb 2010. As you know (or should) Google's tools offer a lot of advantages for collaboration.

							But as nice as this tool is in various ways, it doesn't look great. It let you use the web, but in a lowest-common-denominator sort of way. It offers some conveniences but denies others.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="none">
						<h2>Back Home</h2>
						<h3>HTML5</h3>
						<p>Keynote</p>
						<img src="img/html5.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							So when I was asked to speak about HTML5 to the Five College Libraries' Digital Environment Development and Coordinating Committee (DEDCC) I decided to try Apple's Keynote. This was definitely a better tool. It suffers from weird little limitations of its own, but it tended to snap things to where I wanted them, put options where I expected them, and generally feel less frustrating. I had fun with the talk, and it looked better than anything else I'd done.

					<section data-transition="none">
						<h2>HighEdWeb 2011</h2>
						<h3>Swinging with Sinatra</h3>
						<p>Keynote</p>
						<img src="img/sinatra.png"     class="fragment fade-out"  />
						<img src="img/kernelpanic.png" class="fragment" style="position:relative; top:-492px;" />
						<aside class="notes">
							HighEdWeb 2011 was a busy conference for me. I did too much. I volunteered for a few things (registration, band), I presented a poster, and I gave another 45-minute talk. This time I wanted to do something more dynamic and exciting, a live programming demonstration. As luck would have it it was a little more exciting than I would have liked, as my computer (yes, this very computer) let me down (core dump slide) mid stream. This proved a popular diversion, and I got to repeat it two more times. One thing I promised myself was that next time I'd deliver a talk I could present in jeans.

						<h3>I Can Convert!</h3>

						<img src="img/icanconvert2.png" class="fragment" style="position:relative; top:-492px;" />

						<aside class="notes">
							In 2012 Jason Proctor and I collaborated on a talk, and because we wanted it to look nice we used Keynote. Now this time the tool really got in the way. Jason knows a lot more about typography than I do, but I know Keynote better. Our collaboration consisted of sharing some notes, and then working on a single Keynote file in a shared Dropbox folder, being careful not to overwrite each other's changes. We know each other well and we got through this ok but it was really the last straw.

							I did wear jeans, though.

						<h2>Available Presentation Tools</h2>
						<h3>(and their limitations)</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Conventional (Powerpoint, Keynote)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Cloud-based (Google)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Flash-based (Prezi)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Conventional presentation tools offer cryptic and shifting interfaces and little or no collaboration functionality.
							Google's presentation tool offers much better collaboration support but limited presentational flexibility.
							Some people were starting to use Prezi, of course, and that was impressive the first time I saw it, but it doesn't work for everything and it has other drawbacks.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Version Control</h2>
						<h3>What about that, huh?</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							For a dozen years by this point I'd been managing source code in version control systems. First StarTeam, then CVS, SVN, and Git. I invested a lot of time working with these tools, and relied upon them to care for the output of the hours (and the years) I spent at the keyboard doing my main job.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>What About the Web?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							That main job, meanwhile, which had always been one kind of programming or another, had for years been web programming, and by this point for me that meant blue-beanie standards-based web programming, with CSS, yo.

							Around 2000 Opera introduced Opera Show

							With a little CSS you could use the same XHTML for slide show, web, and printed handouts.

							Cross-<em>platform</em>. But limited to Opera. Which you had to pay for.
